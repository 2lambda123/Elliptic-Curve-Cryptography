# Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography

Encryption-Decryption are the fundamental applicatios of Cryptography. Divided into 2 categories:
- Symmetric Key Cryptography
- Asymmetric Key Cryptography

Here, we have chosen an asymmetric key cryptographic method.
 
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is one of the most powerful and secure ecryption method and is an asymmetric key cryptography.

ECC represents the mathematical elliptic curves (y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B) and is based on the principle that it is virtually impossible 
to find a new point when you are given the original point on the curve.<br>
An ECC encryption of <b>256-bit</b> length is equivalent to <b>3072-bit</b> length in RSA.

Here, we tried to show the important mathematical concepts required for better understanding of Elliptic Curve Cryptography and 
implementations of few mathematical concepts regarding Number Theory and Cryptography.
