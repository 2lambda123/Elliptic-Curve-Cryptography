# Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography

Cryptography, while dealing with the security, data integration, digital signature, etc...it requires a very 
high level of mathematics to understand properly and implement.

> Claude E. Shannon is considered by many to be the father of mathematical cryptography.

Encryption-Decryption are the fundamental applicatios of Cryptography. Divided into 2 categories:
- Symmetric Key Cryptography
- Asymmetric Key Cryptography

Here, we have chosen an asymmetric key cryptography.
<p>
  To encrypt and decrypt sensitive information, asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography 
  or public-key encryption, uses mathematically linked public and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ 
  and recipients’ sensitive data

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is one of the most powerful and secure ecryption method and is an asymmetric key cryptography.

ECC represents the mathematical elliptic curves (y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B) and is based on the principle that it is virtually impossible 
to find a new point when you are given the original point on the curve.<br>
An ECC encryption of <b>256-bit</b> length is equivalent to <b>3072-bit</b> length in RSA.
